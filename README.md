# metaverse
An API and front-end for living in a metaverse. It is described by using models, metaphors, and physics as best we can understand and imagine. The metaverse hosts any and all vendors and users of all kinds; we do not discriminate between augmented and virtual reality users, providers, content developers, advertisers, for-profit or non-profit, and so on. Within the metaverse there is a universe for you. Or several. 
The Metaverse is a multiverse comprised of real, imaginary, and augmented universes. It is a platform that is open to all vendors, and is the future of extended reality. Obviously, it will take a ton of code, and coordination of many big-name sponsors, but the time is right for this to come into being.
I will need a lot of help, and if successful, hope to reward our contributors accordingly. As a developer, your code has to be submitted with built-in test cases, and has to conform to our PEP coding style. We are going to use open source languages in our layers:
At the persistence layer, we use SQLAlchemy https://www.sqlalchemy.org/ to hide whether we are using MySQL or PostGres or Mongo
At the API Layer, we use Python 3 with built-in testing
For the XR/AR presentation we will need to rely on each vendor's specifications for sending the model to the glassess
For the web presentation we will use JavaScript, specifically the Angular library and Data-Driven Document (D3) libraries (along with a python-driven web server) 
For the commerce layer, we have yet to select a platform although we know it must support cryptocurrencies in the US. 
We think various vendors will have their own e-commerce platforms, and marketing/advertising platforms as well. We need to embrace and standardize the user experience when we can, so that the user has a clear and consistent purchase experience. 
Every commit must be fully commented, contain a full suite of regression test cases, use clear english in all naming, and be object-oriented.
As a citizen and service based in the United States of America, this metaverse is governed by all its laws and regulations. 
I welcome your contributions, and promise to be fair to everyone. Let's create something historic!
