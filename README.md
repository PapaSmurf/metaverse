# metaverse
A system for living in a metaverse. It is described by using models, metaphors, and physics as best we can understand and imagine. The metaverse hosts any and all vendors and users of all kinds; we do not discriminate between augmented and virtual reality users, providers, content developers, advertisers, for-profit or non-profit, and so on. Within the metaverse there is a universe for you. Or several. 
The Metaverse is a multiverse comprised of real, imaginary, and augmented universes. It is a platform that is open to all vendors, and is the future of extended reality. Obviously, it will take a ton of code, and coordination of many big-name sponsors, but the time is right for this to come into being.
We need a lot of help, and if successful, hope to reward our contributors accordingly. As a developer, your code has to conform to our PEP coding style and practices. We are going to use open source languages in our layers:
     At the persistence layer we will use relational (MySQL) and document-oriented (Mongodb) databases. 
     At the persistence interface layer, we use SQLAlchemy https://www.sqlalchemy.org/ to objectify our data
     At the API Layer, we use Python 3 with built-in test cases following the MVC pattern
     For the XR/AR presentation we will need to rely on each vendor's specifications for sending the model to the glasses
     For the web presentation we will use JavaScript, specifically the Angular library and Data-Driven Document (D3) libraries (along with a python-driven web server) 
     For a native presentation, we will use Blender as a seamless way to create, edit, and submit content. 
     For the commerce layer, we have yet to select a platform although we know it must support secure wallets, cryptocurrencies in the US, taxation where required, and reporting. We think various vendors will have their own e-commerce platforms, and marketing/advertising platforms as well. We need to embrace and standardize the user experience when we can, so that the user has a clear and consistent purchase experience. 

Every commit must be fully tested and commented, contain a full suite of regression test cases, use clear english in all naming, and be object-oriented.
As a citizen and as a service based in the United States of America, this metaverse is governed by all its laws and regulations. 
I welcome your contributions, and promise to be fair to everyone. Let's create something historic!
